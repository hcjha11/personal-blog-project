                    <b>I like boxes.</b> The box is <b>the greatest invention since fire</b> in my honest opinion. The
                    thing is that
                    nothing can be more practical than a box. It fits perfectly in any space and anytime. You have to
                    store something? There is a box! You have to move to another space or time? There is a box! I bet
                    you are currently living in a box, too. Can you imagine that what would we, as humanity do if there
                    would be no boxes? The first box marked the point where our civilization began and the last box will
                    show the end of human civilization. There is no time where there are no boxes. Just think about it!
                    Of course there are "regular" boxes like old wooden boxes and newer cartoon paper boxes, but
                    wagons are boxes, houses are boxes, cars and trucks are boxes, even the computer where you read my
                    blog post is a box.

                   Boxes may be made of durable materials such as wood or metal, or of corrugated fiberboard, paperboard,
                    or other non-durable materials.The size may vary from very small (e.g., a matchbox) to the size of a 
                    large appliance. A corrugated box is a very common shipping container. When no specific shape is described,
                     a box of rectangular cross-section with all sides flat may be expected, but a box may have a horizontal 
                     cross section that is square, elongated, round or oval; sloped or domed top surfaces, or vertical edges.
                      They are not always made up of squares.

                    A corrugated box is a shipping container or product container made of corrugated fiberboard.[1] These are
                     most commonly used to transport and warehouse products during distribution, and are rated according to the
                      strength of the material or the capacity of the finished box. They are also used as product packaging or
                       POP displays.

                  Boxes for storing various items in can often be very decorative,
                   as they are intended for permanent use and sometimes are put on
                    display in certain locations.

                   The following are some types of storage boxes :

                   A jewelry (AmE) or jewellery (BrE) box, is a box for trinkets or jewels.
                    It can take a very modest form with paper covering and lining, covered
                     in leather and lined with satin, or be larger and more highly decorated.
                 A humidor is a special box for storing cigars at the proper humidity, by means
                  of absorbent materials that retain and moderate moisture coming from the cigars.
                   Powered boxes can also maintain the right temperature.[citation needed]
                  A "strong box" or safe, is a secure lockable box for storing money or other 
                  valuable items. The term "strong box" is sometimes used for safes that are no 
                  longer portable boxes but are installed in a wall or floor for increased security.

                        Letter box (in the US usually called mailbox), positioned near or on the mail
                         recipient's home or place of work.office box, (often abbreviated P.O. box or 
                         PO box), a box rented by the mail recipient to be an independent postal address,
                          located in a post office or in the premises of a company offering such facilities.
                           Self-service boxes are unlocked by the recipient, otherwise, a postal clerk retrieves
                            the mail.
